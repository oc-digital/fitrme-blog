# The Rules of the Fitrme Revolution

intro

## 1. Come as you are but know where you want to go

Maybe you're here because you're frustrated because you haven't found the fitness success you've been searching for quite yet. Maybe you're doctor told you that you have or are at risk for some serious health issues if you don't make changes. Maybe you just had a kid and the reality that __YOUR__ health __**could**__ make THEIR life much more difficult just hit you like a ton of bricks. Maybe you just want to wake up, look in the mirror, and feel great about yourself. Whatever your reason, welcome to the Fitrme Revolution.

The Fitrme Revolution cares about where you want to go, NOT about where you came from or how you got here. We all have baggage &ndash; different backgrounds, gentetics, circumstances, social statuses, and commitments. Life, to a large extent, is like a game of [Cribbage](). We're dealt a hand over which we had absolutely no control and now it's up to us to play that hand to the best of our ability.

Your mission is to become better today than you were yesterday. You do that by knowing where you want to be and focusing on what you can do **today** to improve and grow. Do that enough and your progress will astound you!

## 2. Question everything

We understand that the science is rarely, if ever, settled. We prefer to keep an open mind knowing science is a process of examination and exploration, not a "fact", pronouncement, or conclusion.

[Galileo Galilei](), "Who would dare assert that we know all ther is to be known?"

Just because we saw it on TV, read it in a magazine, or heard it in a news broadcast doesn't mean it's true. Just because the FDA says something is good/bad for us doesn't make it true. We question with boldness and examine statements for ourselves.

Fitrme and the Revolution exist, in part, to help open our minds to new ideas, possiblities, and ways of thinking. If we can change our thinking, we can change your life. As Oliver Wendell Holmes said, "Man's mind, once stretched by a new idea, never regains its original dimensions."

## 3. Finish what you start

No more yo-yo dieting. No more working out for 2 weeks and going back to the way things were. No more quiting!

If we want to gain momentum and improve our motivation, start by setting small but meaningful goals that are highly achievable. Master the basics and practice them every day. Small disciplines repeated with consistency lead to great achievements gained slowly over time. Remember, our goal is to promote and create healthy, sustainable habits.

We start small, think big, work hard, finish what we start, and never quit.

## 4. Measure and track for success

Starting a body recomposition program without measurements is like planning a trip without a starting address &ndash; it only leads to future regret.

I cannot stress enough the importance of tracking your progress. If you want to make significant changes in a given area, tracking even a mediocre variable will help you develop awareness which leads to the right behavioral changes.

## 5. Nutrition is king

When it comes to losing fat or building muscle, 80% of our success will be a direct result of what we eat. Slacking on nutrition is by far the #1 reason why most of us don't achieve the results we want. This is why the first thing that must change when you join the Fitrme Revolution is your eating habits.

When I say "eating habits", I'm not talking about switching to eating all salads and water or juicing our way to results. I'm talking about making small, calculated changes to what you eat over a long period of time. We understand that, as a general rule, the total number of calories we eat impacts our health. We also understand that Calories are NOT all alike and that WHAT we eat is just as important as quantity, if not more so.

## 6. Train with conviction, intelligence, and real world movements

Our workouts are deliberate, purposeful, and efficient &ndash designed to allow us to live the lifestyle we choose and become the people we were meant to be. We know what we want and have a plan to get there. We have a very compelling reason why changing our body and health is important to us.

Life is dynamic and so is oour trianing program. To promote muscular stability and balance, we favor exercises using dumbbells, free weights, and / or body weight over weight machines which only work our muscles in a straight line (ex. forward and back, up and down, etc). Our training program is flexible enough to allow us to workout anywhere &ndash; NO EXCUSES!

## 7. Be Amazing
