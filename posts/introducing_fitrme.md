# Introducing Fitrme

Hey everyone!

I'm super excited to announce Fitrme is ready for Fitees &ndash; that's you! As I continue to polish the Fitrme application, I want to start sharing more with you.

I thought you might like to know why I've been pouring so much of my life for so long into this concept called Fitrme. Well, it's simple &ndash; I love helping people. Fitrme fuses my background in [Athletic Training](http://www.nata.org) / [Strength & Conditioning](http://www.nsca.com) with my passion for coding and allows me to affect positive change in the lives of many people.

When I started my career in Athletic Training, I was in the best shape of my life. As I transitioned into a career of web development (it's a long but interesting story), I gained weight &ndash; a LOT of weight. In fact, I'm a bit embarassed to admit that after 10 years of pounding on a keyboard, I'm close to the heaviest I've every been...the irony is not lost on me.

I know what you might be thinking, "Wait...If you're fat and I'm out of shape, why should I listen to you?" The answer is because I've scaled this mountain before and I'll do it again. During my senior year of college, I was in terrible shape. I dropped over 40 pounds and kept it off for over 5 years &ndash; all that learning paid off. More importantly, I've helped others do the same.

## Why Fitrme?

When shedding fat in college, I made heavy use of circuit training dvd's like [Power 90](http://www.beachbody.com/product/fitness_programs/p90-workout.do), walking / jogging, and of course changing my eating habits. After about two weeks, the workouts started getting REALLY boring! The music, the "motivational coaching" &ndash; it all became monotonous. I didn't want to have to endure repetitive workouts again and I didn't want to go to a gym. So, I created Fitrme.

## What is Fitrme?

Fitrme is, at its core, a dynamic [circuit training](https://fitrme.com/blog/posts/circuit-training-basics) workout factory. Each workout is personalized based on your available equipment and fitness level. By combining resistance training with continuous movement, each circuit allows you to [burn more calories in less time](https://fitrme.com/blog/posts/the-benefits-of-circuit-training). The best part, you never have to repeat a workout!

## What's Next?

For me and hopefully for you, it's making health and fitness a priority. I'm committed to completing three Fitrme circuits per week for the next twelve weeks. By the end of the year, I hope to complete 150 Fitrme circuits &ndash; lofty but achievable goals if fitness is a made a priority ;)

Fitrme is still a diamond in the rough. With your help, I'm looking forward to cutting, shaping, and polishing it into something spectacular. You're feedback, suggestions, praises, and criticisms are vitally import for the growth and success of Fitrme. I want to personally thank you in advance for helping make this something truly amazing!
